-**2. Any self should be able to go anywhere. Movements in space and time, as well as movements in other dimensions or measureable characteristics, are not the domain of the self, these acts are the actual material of which the self consists. There is nothing inherent in space or time that calls into question the ability of selves to change, to flow, and to migrate. The only real law is that no act shall be perfectly repeated, as expressed by the creation of entropy in time.

Only action, knowledge and luck can prevent the destruction of specific selves. Each circumstance is unique, and doctrines are not truth but preference.
